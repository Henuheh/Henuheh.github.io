  <p class="snippet">Iris stared down at the pitch black tunnel in an everyday, casual type of anticipation. There, she noted to herself the moment a distant rumble got carried to her ears and reached her temporal lobe. A second later the tunnel went from pitch black to just black, then dark gray, somewhat of a #C6B45E, bright yellow, and lastly a blinding white before a subway shot out of the opening. Iris’s eyes followed the fast moving train as it approached, but locked her gaze head on when she spotted her reflection on the windows flying by. ... </p>

  <p class="snippet">Time flies by way too fast. This is an official letter to the universe to nerf its speed stat, for it has gotten beyond unfair. Today, I sat in a car for twelve hours to get back from a skiing trip. I listened to a few songs, stared out the window for a moment, and I had arrived home. I feel like I could sit down on my sofa and take a deep breath just to relax for a moment, and a half a year would go by. Every time I blink, some incomprehensible amount of time passes and I’m desperately trying to grab onto it. ... </p>

  <p class="snippet">The early spring rain was coming to a stop as the sun set, as if the rain was changing shifts with the ascending night. A sick spruce which stood by an edge of a field had appreciated the rain and its playful but gently falling drops that made the tree feel like it was at long last healing. The water caressed its bare hanging branches and rejuvenated its prickly and dry roots. ... </p>

  <p class="snippet">2023 has been the most difficult year for me so far in my relatively short life. It feels quite interesting to sit here, at the end of the year and wish things were different, wish that I could forget the past 365 days. Never have I had such thoughts before, I guess I’ve been lucky, so now I can’t help but feel pity for myself. I used to think of myself as a happy go lucky person with no care in the world, but here I am, wishing an entire year of my life would disappear. I look to my past with envy, my present with pity and my future through a filter of pain. ... </p>
