  <p class="snippet">Time flies by way too fast. This is an official letter to the universe to nerf its speed stat, for it has gotten beyond unfair. Today, I sat in a car for twelve hours to get back from a skiing trip. I listened to a few songs, stared out the window for a moment, and I had arrived home.
