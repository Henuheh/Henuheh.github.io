    Going, Going, Gone is a game project I've been working since summer of 2024. The main goal of the project is for me to learn and understand different aspects of game development I haven't had much experience in. I wanted to start with a simple idea and an objective I could see myself reach, and I'm happy to look at the progress I've made so far. I found that coding and puzzle design are something I enjoy a ton, but also writing the script and tying the mechanics and narrative together has been an interesting challenge.<br><br>

    You can download and play the current build <a class="projectlink" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HkwNcnQfDLGlbCk88j2FSOhryYAwc5wX?usp=sharing">from here</a>!<br><br>

    Going, Going, Gone is a grid based puzzle game, where the player leaves a shadow behind each time they change direction. The shadow restricts the player's movement, so they need to navigate the levels without blocking themselves from reaching the portal to the next level. <br><br>

    I have thought about the game as an artistic and emotional expression. I want to keep the UI and controls minimal, the story abstract and the puzzles fun and satisfying instead of super challengeing. I intend the story to be meaningful for those who get it, while others not able to relate might not find it interesting as such. I still aim for it to be a pleasant and interesting experience for all.<br><br> 

    While developing this game I have relied on one game design pillar. I want everything in the game to support and culminate to its last moment, its narrative climax (there won't be anything further like falling action or resolution). So every line I write, every mechanic I develop, every design decision I make has to fall in line with this last moment. I want to create a moment the player will take with them from this game, a moment they will remember, a moment they can reflect upon when they find themselves in a similar situation as the character. <br><br>

    Right now the order of levels is in the order of which I came up with them, and even though it currently doesn't provide the best player experience, I think it is interesting to see how my thinking and design skills have developed through this time. <br><br>

   I didn't expect this journey to be as important as it has been. When I look at the build and how much of actual content there is so far, it's not much, but oh, how I am so unnecessarily proud of it all. I think I can condence it to two points. First of all, I had a huge mental treshold to start developing on my own. I'm scared of failure, creating something subpar, starting a project but never finishing it. I guess the greatest fear is truly proving to myself that I can't be a developer after all. During school I did production, relying on my teams, now I'm all alone with this. I have wanted to start to develop something for years, but I haven't been able to bring myself to it becuase of beforementioned things. So the fact that I've gotten even this far, by developing a little each week, keeping in mind the one minute rule, makes me really happy. And I don't see myself quitting any time soon, I'm not in a hurry, it will take as long as it needs to. Secondly, the experience of game testing it with my friends has been the greatest joy. Sure, they are my friends and support me no matter what, so there is a bias. But seeing each of them play with their own style, figuring the mechanics and puzzles out, and to my surprise, being motivated to keep going and solving even when they get stuck. They said that time just flew by as they played, and I think that has been the most encouraging compliment I could've gotten. If not for any other reason, I would just finish the game to see my friends play and celebrate as they reach the end. <br><br>

    With the build I currently got, for an inexperienced player there is about 1,5 hours of content, while an experienced player can clear it in 30 minutes. <br></p>
