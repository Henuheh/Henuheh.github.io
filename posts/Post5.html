  <h2>Anxiety</h2>
  <h5 class="blogdatepost">Diary, Apr 25, 2024</h5>
  <p class="blogtext"> I feel heavy. I have always felt the weight of my social anxiety, but this year the heaviness crossed the threshold where I can’t forget about it for the most part like I used to be able to. The weight has gotten too oppressive, too strenuous, too much for me to ignore. I feel it in me, residing somewhere near the heart, every waking moment and see it reflected in my dreams. I have wanted to write about social anxiety ever since I became aware of how big of a role it plays in my life, but that was even before I came up with this little blog site, so I never got around doing it. Mostly because there was no external reason to, nowhere to document my experience. Now that I have gotten into the habit of writing and feel my anxiety more noticeably present in me than ever before, I might as well take a shot at understanding what is making me increasingly withdrawn, what is driving me to isolation. <br><br>

This topic is not something I often talk about with anyone, maybe bits and pieces surface here and there in conversation, but I don’t think I have ever processed my social persona in its wretched and grand entirety, written or spoken. So here, in the following paragraphs, are a bunch of thoughts trying to form a comprehensible picture of a big, scarily significant, part of me, for the first time. Sorry if it turns out to be a mess, I’m still trying to understand it all by myself through what I’m about to write. My unorganized and unfinished thoughts seem to be caught in a tangled yarn ball of awkward writing and stiff English, but let’s see how I manage to unravel them.<br><br>

I have been socially awkward and quiet since the end of elementary school. Before that I recall being more outgoing and sociable, but something happened as I developed into a teen. I got more nerdy and edgy, I almost exclusively dressed in boys’ clothing, withstood some bullying and definitely embraced my class’ awkward weirdo title. But I had friends, so I didn’t really care. I didn’t think much in terms of social anxiety and shyness, I used to force all those aspects of my social personality into “introvert”. I first did the MBTI-test when I was fourteen and since then I have considered myself an introvert (INTJ according to Myers-Briggs), and that was the beginning and end of me trying to understand my social life for a long time. I simply didn’t need to think about it, much less work on it, because I never felt lonely. I'm lucky enough to have made great friends in my early childhood who are still in my life to this day. Everything was good, I felt happy and normal, and it lasted for a surprisingly long time. It wasn’t until my early adulthood that I started to struggle and had to take a lengthy and pitiful look in the mirror. <br><br>

In university I noticed that I had a hard time socializing with people despite wanting to do so, and that was the first time I really felt and noticed the negative effects of my introvertedness. It became quickly apparent that networking is a crucial part of my studies and the game development field as a whole, and I desperately just couldn’t bring myself to do it in any shape or form, which worried me further. But it wasn’t until I got into working life, where I have failed to make the connections I have wanted to make, where I can’t ask for the help I need, where I feel truly hindered and disadvantaged because of my social temperament, I figured that there has got to be a bit more to this than just me being an introvert. I was, and I still very much am, being held back by my incapability to take contact with the people around me.<br><br>

I need an invite to talk to people. A factor that stopped me from diagnosing my social anxiety earlier was that I didn’t fit the image I had of it in my head. Making a call to book an appointment, ordering food or asking someone to help me with a product in a store feels completely fine. I even enjoy giving presentations in front of a crowd, and that doesn’t sound like something someone with social anxiety would like, right? But there is a catch! In these kinds of customer service situations the roles are clear. I'm supposed to ask for a service or the other persons’ help, so initiating conversation feels acceptable. If someone tells me to make a presentation and talk in front of people, sure, no problem, there was an invitation to do so. If another person approaches me, even a stranger, and strikes up a conversation, I feel perfectly fine and love to talk and get to know new people. <br><br>

Social anxiety stops me from initiating conversations without a practical, external, reason with strangers, coworkers, students, anyone really, unless they are someone really close to me. I need an invitation to talk, a reason to approach, a permission to initiate communication. I myself or the things I could talk about are not enough. My problem is in having absolutely zero confidence that someone would want to talk to me. I don’t feel like I have the permission to approach anyone, because why on earth would anyone want to associate with me? What if I’m being a bother, an annoyance? Why do I think I can invite myself to this conversation or event, who do I think I am? I can never ask to join someone, I can only be invited, and there are no exceptions. If it is not clearly shown that I’m wanted, I won’t show up, and even if it is shown I’ll question it a thousand times over. <br><br>

It’s really quite hard to explain the exact feeling I get and the reasoning I go through in my head when I’m faced with a social situation where I’m supposed to initiate conversation. I feel paralyzed, shut down and usually run into a bathroom or flee completely. I wouldn’t mind just sitting alone, but I fear judgment from others. I feel like the weirdo I was in middle school again, but I really don’t want to be her. Back in school I used to pity anyone who got paired up with me, and at work I feel bad for my team for having me be a part of it. I don’t go to the office too often because I feel like the people there would quickly grow tired of me, and I don’t want to force my company on them. I feel rather bad for thinking this way, because my coworkers have never been anything but nice to me. Hell, my team made the decision to hire me, so why on earth can’t I just confide in them??? Anxiety is a bi<br><br>

Shyness plays a big part of my anxiety. If I was charismatic, an extrovert, someone smart with clever things to say, a talented and empathetic listener and conversationalist, would my anxiety be there? But I’m a shy, socially awkward nerd, so it feels hard for me to justify to myself why would I have the worth of initiating conversation with someone. There is also a lot of overthinking and insecurity that are hard working contributors to this anxiety mess, questioning everything that I’ve said or might say, keeping me quiet. <br><br>

Making friends is difficult for me. I have barely made any since elementary school. There have been instances of budding friendships through the years, but I’m not able to follow up. I can’t ask someone to hang out with me. I can’t for my life imagine anyone actually wanting to be friends with me, I don’t have the confidence to reach out. And unfortunately  communication is a two way street, and my street is heavily under construction by a company that went bankrupt when I was twelve, and I have only managed to hire cheap and lousy contractors who abandon the project and run away with the down payment ever since. I just can’t imagine, I can’t believe, I can’t justify for myself to be of any worth as a friend. Maybe because it has been so long since I have made friends I just don’t know how to do it anymore, I don’t understand the role I’m supposed to play. <br><br>

With romantic partners I don’t have the same issue. I feel comfortable dating, and from the beginning the road is smoothly paved and well lit. I was trying to understand why some time ago, and I realized the reason is that in a romantic relationship I have a clear role. I know what I can offer to the other person, I know that in a relationship and dating I have value. I’m convinced that I’m allowed to have a romantic relationship, it is to be expected, and I know what I have to do. I don’t feel shy or scared when I go on a date, I’m fine. I even feel comfortable initiating conversations on Tinder, reaching out first after the date, or even asking the other person out first. My social anxiety just doesn’t apply to dating, and I believe that is because I know my role and believe in my worth in a romantic relationship. <br><br>

But obviously romantic relationships have their own problems. After my last relationship I realized I can’t rely on that one day I will have all my social needs met by this one magical man who will stick with me for the rest of my life. I need to plan my life around me being alone to be happy. But the thing is, I want someone to play games with, talk about stories and fantasy, someone to whom I can talk about my ideas and they can share theirs with me, watch movies and series, enjoy and share music. Go to the cabin in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. I feel an immense longing for someone who is like me. For someone who likes the same things as I do. As much as I love my friends, they are all very different, and for a long time I’ve been feeling quite lonely. I also think that having no one around me who is into the same things as me is giving me a harder time to validate myself and my worth. I just can’t help to imagine what it is like having a friend or a partner to share things with, to get excited over similar topics and share the same passions. In my last relationship I couldn’t share my interests, I was made to feel quite inferior over the things I enjoyed. But at least being with someone in the first place masked that feeling of loneliness, but the mask is no longer there and I can see my loneliness exposed, butt naked. <br><br>

I feel heavy. As my friends have their own close friends, relationships, comings and goings, I can’t help but feel like they are so much more important to me than I am to them. They are my everything, whereas I am just an option for them. The scales are tipped so drastically to my side, and everyone can see that. When I think about the times when I have been the happiest in my life, it is when I’m with them, going on an adventure, even if it is only to the neighboring city. I remember my grandma saying some years ago how she lives on the memories of me and my cousins when we were kids. I didn’t really understand her back then, but I do better these days. <br><br> 

It all makes me feel so vulnerable. I don’t want to reach out, I don’t want to share anymore. I feel the urgent need to be alone and isolate myself. I need to balance the scales. <br><br>

This year, as my loneliness and I have gotten to know each other better, I have come to accept my shyness and anxiety. I don’t feel the need to do better in social situations, I don’t feel the need to “heal” my introverted side as I used to do. I’m tired of telling myself the following day that at work tomorrow I will be social, or that I will talk to this new person in this upcoming event. and then beind always let down by myself. Now, I’m quiet, shy, awkward and alone, but I’m okay with that. Being alone feels safe, accepting myself as I am and withdrawing feels good. It has started to feel like the world is in a better balance the less I try to fight myself. I yearn for someone who is like me, but I think I’m okay without them as well. Isolation is tempting me with her safe embrace. 
<br><br>
I don't know if I will ever “heal”. I have lived like this for so long I can’t imagine myself ever being any other way. I’m not looking for empathy, and oh, how I hate the pity. The worst feeling in this world is when someone comes to talk to me because they pity the fact I sit alone. I am like this because it is me, no one did this to me, and the only one that can do anything about it is me. Save your pity, for I don’t want to feel pathetic about who I am. <br><br>

I want to disappear, fade away. Take my notebook and my cat, move far, be amongst people who don’t know me and never will. <br><br>

 I want to feel weightless.
