  <h2>Pain</h2>
  <h5 class="blogdatepost">Diary, Dec 28, 2023</h5>
  <p class="blogtext"> 2023 has been the most difficult year for me so far in my relatively short life. It feels quite interesting to sit here, at the end of the year and wish things were different, wish that I could forget the past 365 days. Never have I had such thoughts before, I guess I’ve been lucky, so now I can’t help but feel pity for myself. I used to think of myself as a happy go lucky person with no care in the world, but here I am, wishing an entire year of my life would disappear. I look to my past with envy, my present with pity and my future through a filter of pain. <br><br>

  If only I could start 2024 on a blank, clean and fresh, baby cheek smooth page. Unfortunately, as there are only few more days to go until the fireworks go off, and the pressure in my chest and the heaviness in my heart seem to want to stick around for some more, I think I’ll have to step into the new year these feelings with me. However, that’s why I am here, writing! My last effort to ditch this shit from my shoulders and shout it into the void of the internet, leave as much of it here on this html document as possible. May someone come across this blog or not, may they relate or not, laugh at me and my naive heartache or not, this is me, my attempt at healing, to help myself even a tiny bit. So far laying on the bed with my face buried into my cats fur hasn’t helped me as much as I had hoped, so I thought to try this instead. I’m not very familiar with writing, but I want to overcome the shame of sharing something imperfect, personal and, well, possibly cringe. So here we go, hold on to your hats, because I just might blow them off with a blast of sappy emotion and mediocre writing that’s about to come.<br><br>

  Of course a boy and a heartache are the main reasons for my pain. Oh, how I detest myself for admitting it, for feeling so deeply because of a single person. I feel a lot of shame, for giving him so much power over me and letting him ruin me, especially since I live in a real life and social media bubble of empowering feminism and powerful women. So how can I let a mere man ruin me? Well, did I let him ruin me, or did he just.. ruin me? I don’t think I gave him permission. However, if I was powerful, self respecting enough, perhaps, I could’ve walked out earlier, before most of the damage was done. I don’t want to go into details about what happened and who did what, but share my thoughts and struggles of walking away from a toxic relationship and dealing with trauma during it and after. Horrible things were said, horrible things were done, horrible things came to light, traumatising me and filling me with anxiety that keeps me in a choke hold to this day, my trust broken into pieces, self esteem obliterated, my heart burned in the blazing bonfire of jealousy, and the list goes on. And after everything, I still feel for this person and I’m incapable of hate or anger. I feel the opposite of strong and independent. I feel like I’m letting myself down, my friends down, all those powerful women, who shared their wisdom and encouragement, down.<br><br>

  I have many times heard how I need to let the past go and how I need to forget. To those who advise me to do this I ask, since I am my past, how can I ever forget? What am I, if not my past experiences and the life that I’ve lived? Moving on or forgetting don’t feel like options for me, because everything that happened lives in me, is me. I entertain the idea where you are simultaneously both your past and future, so the concept of time is unnecessary. I don’t intend to get too philosophical since I really don’t know what I’m talking about, but this line of thinking lets me process my existence and experiences in a more tangible (?) manner. Even though I’m unable to forget and just let the pain go, it brings me peace knowing that the future me, the healed and happy me, is also already within me. So it’s not a case of waiting time to pass and hoping if I do the right things I might be happy again some day, but a case of me simply becoming that person. A seed that grows into a tree holds its future within and its past will show on its bark. My path is laid before me, I only need to traverse it. I will build upon my pain, but it will always remain with me.<br><br>

  During the last year I almost went insane. It is a pure miracle that I’m not in a mental hospital. I recently read what I had written in my journal during the year, even though going through the pages and travelling back to those times made me extremely uncomfortable. Some over half a year ago I had written how talking with this person tears me apart, how I know it’s wrong and how my brain tells me to stop, but how my heart rejoices, how I want nothing more than this person in my life, how I am hooked on our connection and crave the validation. I realised, that since then, my mind and heart have not once been aligned, but I’ve lived in a constant state of cognitive dissonance. The pinnacle of this anguish came when I finally said bye for this person for good, an event that I’m genuinely surprised that I survived. My heart and mind were completely misaligned, my heart breaking into million pieces each minute waiting for the day it was time for him to leave, but my mind still ultimately telling him to leave. All meanwhile experiencing panic attacks and hysteria. I genuinely thought I was going to die the night before he left, I had slept only a few hours during the last few days and despite that I couldn’t fall sleep, my heart beat out of my chest like never before and I was crying and trembling, really believing I was having a heart attack. How I didn’t crumble and ask him to stay with me is beyond me, since that’s what my heart demanded, screamed and threw the most manic fits for. I watched him go. How I prayed for god to have more time, to freeze it and to not have to make the decision. Every day was awful, living was dreadful, watching seconds go by and days pass was torture, I was completely paralysed. The idea that he was going to go, fly back to his country and be incapable of coming back, and I could stop it all if I only said the word “stay”, even just whispered it into the air. The feeling was indescribably crushing. Even though he is gone now and I feel quite safe, I still feel the dissonance, my heart and mind working for different goals. I can’t wait for the day my body is aligned once again, because going on for so long with having to fight this battle against myself is quite exhausting.<br><br>

  So how on earth did I stay with a person like this and how did I end up in such a dreadful mental state, you might ask! Well there are a few credible reasons I have thought of. First is trauma bonding. I used to believe trauma bonding happened when two people shared a common trauma or struggle and bonded over that, sharing and empathising with each other. Oh boy was I wrong, at least according to my therapist. She told me that trauma bonding happens when these persons’ traumas get hooked on each other. For me, my previous experience had made me a person with a bad self esteem, a person who puts their partner’s needs in-front of their own, rationalises the partner’s bad behaviour, a person who is ready to turn a blind eye to mistreatment as long as they can feel valued and important every now and then. On the other hand my previous partner’s trauma had made him a person who demands a lot from their partner, experiences themselves as a victim of this world, incapable of taking accountability. He experienced that bad things don’t come from him, they come from outside and only go through him. He was capable of showering me with love, making me feel like I’m on top of the world, the most important person in his life, as long as I gave him what he needed. He also craved the validation from someone else just as I did, and in a similar manner got hooked to the person who gave it to him. So we went together like perfect puzzle pieces, but oh how the picture the puzzle formed was ugly. The relationship was addictive, hooking, impossible to let go of, despite all the misfortune it brought to both of our lives.<br><br>

  The second reason for staying is that he still has the say over how much I’m worth. During our relationship, because of things that happened, I was made feel boring, blatantly bland and normal, not special at all. I was compared to other people, which drowned me in jealousy, a feeling I was blissfully unfamiliar with before. I ended up feeling like I’m easily and effortlessly replaceable, and my only worth is from loving this other person. Even though he is gone now, I feel like he still dictates my worth. That’s why it was hard not to have him in my life and why I kept returning to him, as he is the only one who can grant me worthiness, give me a reason to live and breathe. I am very well aware that this is not the truth, that I’m valuable just as I am, but my heart has a very hard time believing that.<br><br>

  Few notes from my journal, just so I won't forget:<br><br>

  1st of March “The missing of him feels quite peaceful. But I can notice a disturbance in the background, as if the memories I go through are glitching. I notice it, but decide not to acknowledge it. Acknowledging is painful. But on the other hand, imagining myself looking at broken memories as if there was nothing wrong with them feels extremely sad.”<br><br>

  3rd of April “The only thing I could do is cry. I looked into his eyes and he tried convinced me that we are doing better and that he loves me. That we are going to move abroad to some countryside, get bunch of cats and dogs and beautiful plants and trees. When I looked into his eyes I saw us on a hill by the sea where we once stood together. I loved him so much, but I knew we were going to break up. I knew I need to leave. The sorrow is immense, when the person I loved so much but who also caused me pain is trying to relief it by loving me more, but it just breaks me instead. I learned what ‘love hurts’ means in that moment.”<br><br>

  13th of June “Do you know how it feels to grow in two separate relationships for 5 plus years where you are the side character, the other person is more valid, important, smart and their ideas and experiences, ways of living are superior? How can I possibly feel worthy after that?”<br><br>

  17th of November “I knew this would happen. Why did I let him back? Did I miss this pain? Am I looking for these sharp, strong emotions? Does this make me feel alive? But I want to die”<br><br>

  The anxiety burned me during the last phase of our relationship, the jealousy drowned me in its vast murky waters, the paranoia drove me insane and emotions threw me up and down like the world’s craziest rollercoaster with the safety belt on only half the way. The rare moments I was happy was when I managed to feel like I lived in a vacuum with him, so that nothing other than us existed. The only way our relationship could’ve worked anymore was if we were shot into space. Trust is a mirror, and I cut myself deep trying to glue the broken pieces back together.<br><br>

  I’m struggling trying to figure out the objective truth of what happened. I wish I could say that I was a good person and he a bad one, case closed. But I can’t. I saw him suffer, I saw him genuinely try and care for me. How can something go so horribly wrong when both parties authentically love each other? How can it go so drastically, unmistakably south? I don’t understand. I realise he did things that are objectively bad, but it so hard to give judgement when I witnessed the struggle he was going through. I’m too empathetic to his logic, unable to deny him and say to him that your truth doesn’t fit my reality. But I keep wanting to find the fault and answer in myself. If I was responsible to everything that happened, I could just fix it, right? I could change myself and not have to worry about anything similar happening in the future, to fix and change things would all be in my control. Unfortunately, the truth exists somewhere in that cursed grey area. It’s hard to live with. No bad or good people, just people who are victims to their circumstance.<br><br>

  I don’t like the person I became. I hate that I couldn’t help him. I hate that I couldn’t hold myself up anymore. I have so much shame and pain it feels like trying to move on is trying to climb over the mountains of madness. I’ve lost myself, I don’t know what I want, what I’m good at, if at anything, or if I am a person worthy and capable of a healthy relationship down the road. I often feel disgusted at the world, at the opposite sex and I’m so so scared of getting hurt again. I genuinely owe my life to my friends and family who have listened and supported me through everything. I apologise that I was causing worry and frustration when I made the wrong decisions, but when I struggle to think what I can live for, you are the answer.<br><br>

  I know I will heal, for I can feel that part already somewhere within me, ready to sprout and bloom. I’ll never be as naive and innocent, as optimistic, as I was before this relationship, but hell, am I wiser and more grown. Life is transactional after all.<br><br>
