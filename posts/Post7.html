  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <h5 class="blogdatepost">Short story, Aug 29, 2024</h5>

<p class="blogtext">
”Holy fuck what just happened?? It's like I got electrocuted!”<br>
”Woah my head is spinning… That shock went through my whole body, but I feel surprisingly.. good?” <br>
”What the fuck was that man?? It was that box! We touched that box and got the shit electrocuted out of us!”<br>
”Oh yeah… Did you saw the man appear as well?” <br>
”Yeah I saw the old man, kinda hard to miss when something just pops out of the thin air and throws a giant box at you”.<br>
”Okay so it was not just my imagination, check. I tried to catch it, but I saw you reach out as well. It’s just us, everybody else is gone… Must be that box then, I don’t think anyone else touched it.”<br>
”I don’t get it, the fuck is going on, where even are we?”<br>
Araf took a more concious look around the space he was standing in. ”A factory..?” He took his best, but quite unhelpful, guess. <br><br>

The room they were in was spacious with a high ceiling, covered in rusted pipes and tubes crisscrossing each other. There were a few rows of fluorecent lights, which Araf was ready to bet his money on were last lit decades ago.  All the surfaces were panneled, giving an impression that anyone or anything might bust in the room from any angle. There was a single closed door on his right and a massive industrial metallic table between him and Hugh. And a few meters away on the ground was a black box, staying menacingly still. On the wall opposite of the door were huge cracked windows, that poured in the last light of the day from a cloudless sky. <br><br>

”Hey, Hugh. The sky is not on fire”, Araf pointed out, staring out the window with a puzzled look. <br>
”Huh?” Hugh tried to process what Araf was saying, and then it hit him. The colour drained from his face as he also stared out the window in to the beautiful evening sky, looking like he had seen a ghost, or more like death himself. ”We are not dying?” <br>
”I don’t think we are”, Araf carefully confirmed. ”No, I don’t think we are”, he repeated, touching his body just to make sure it was really alive and accounted for. <br>
”No, no, no, we were supposed to die. We were just about to die. The shit was raining from the sky, we said good bye! I am supposed to be dead, Araf!” Hugh shouted desperately, as color returned to his face as the adrenaline took a second round through his body.<br>
”I don’t know what to say… I wonder what happened to the others, were they left behind? Did they.. die?” <br>
Hugh didn’t seem to hear Araf, as he kneeled down, breaking down to tears. ”I should be dead… Why the fuck am I not dead? This has to be a nightmare, this is not real”, <br>
”Hey woah, we are alive! This is good right? We don’t know what happened, the others might also be alive!” Araf cheered and stepped closer to Hugh in a manly effort to comfort him. ”That box, I think it saved us!” <br>
”Saved us?!  There was no more saving or condemning us! We were long past the point of any of that mattering anymore, save or condem, death was the answer!”<br>
”Hugh… I don’t underst-”<br>
”Of course you don’t, you had your friends and plans all along!” Hugh cried under his arms. ”What the fuck man what am I supposed to do…”<br>
Araf stood there for a moment looking for words, but couldn’t find any. Clueless how to help his friend, he did the next best thing he could come up with. He awkwardly  shifted away from Hugh and reached down the black box ”Hey hey, let’s check this out maybe it will give us a clue!” 
Hugh peeked over his arm, but there was no lighting, shock, or any effect what so ever when Araf touched the box. Slightly dissappointed, he turned his head back into his lap. <br><br>
Araf found the box surprisingly heavy, and he needed the strength of his both arms to lift the it onto the massive table in the middle of the room. There was a lid and buttons along a single side of the box, the other surfaces empty. Araf rotated the buttons to face him and found himself looking at a regular number pad and play, pause and rewind buttons. There was a yellow sticky note on the lid which Araf ripped off. ”My subortinates are coming. Please, proceed as quickly as possible before they catch you. The next cassette should be nearby,” Araf read out loud. <br>
”Uh, what?” Hugh was now looking up at him, eyes still red but his confused, slightly annoyed, expression gave off that he was successfully distracted. ”Who are coming? To catch us?” Araf was lost in thought with the same questions. He poked the lid and it opened up. First there was a puff of smoke and a smell of something burning, then a cassette popped up. The reel inside was almost done burning, and the last bit of smoke dissolved into the air. Araf carefully tried to touch it, but the cassette case itself seemed to be fine so he picked it up. It was labeled 1966. <br>
”Araf, are you listening to me?”<br>
”Huh?” <br>
”Who the hell are after us? What is that thing?”<br>
”Oh, I don’t know any better than you do… This seems to be an oversized cassette player. They had those back in the day.”<br>
”How young do you think I am? I remember those, come on.”<br>
Araf looked around and locked his eyes with the only other point of interest in the room, the door. ”I don’t know if there are people after us for real, what happened or where we are. But I’ve played enough of video games to get an idea. I say we go find that cassette and pop it in.” <br>
”Are you out of your goddamn mind? What do you think this is? It ain’t a game that’s for sure.”<br>
”Well what would you suggest we do? Sit here and risk getting caught by whatever is after us?”<br>
”I don’t know. I don’t care. I’m not gonna do anything a guy electrocuting me with a box tells me to do. He can come find me and ask really nice in person, so I can kick him in the guts and tell him no.” <br>
”I am not going to force you. But it’s not like we got anything better to do. If not for the person who left this note, but would you come for me?”<br>
