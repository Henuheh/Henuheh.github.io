  <h2>Passion</h2>
  <h5 class="blogdatepost">Diary, Feb 3, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blogtext">Time flies by way too fast. This is an official letter to the universe to nerf its speed stat, for it has gotten beyond unfair. Today, I sat in a car for twelve hours to get back from a skiing trip. I listened to a few songs, stared out the window for a moment, and I had arrived home. I feel like I could sit down on my sofa and take a deep breath just to relax for a moment, and a half a year would go by. Every time I blink, some incomprehensible amount of time passes and I’m desperately trying to grab onto it. Kind of like the people in those arcade money booths, where a person is inside a glass container with banknotes blowing around them, and they win as much they manage to grab onto. I guess I’m in that part of adulthood now.<br><br>

The reason why I’m particularly struggling with time anxiety is not because I’m afraid of getting old, sick or dying, no. I’m excited for the days when I get to retire to a garden, warm up the sauna every day and not give a single fuck about the world around me (if my generation will be granted that privilege). Some smart man said that dying is healing from living, and I very much vibe with that idea. It’s something I remind myself every time a plane takes off or when I wake up in the middle of the night and the pile of clothes on the sofa take the shape of a man. The reason why I’ve been thinking about time so much in the past few years and especially recently, is because I lack passion.<br><br>

When I was a kid I was creative, and like many of us, fantasised about all the great things I would do and achieve when I got more knowledge and the thrilling autonomy of adulthood. I remember distinctly thinking that my biggest fear was losing my imagination. Well… I can’t say that fear came completely true, I guess I can squeeze a few drops of it when absolutely necessary, but boy am I running dry. Imagination, creativity, curiosity and passion are all a beautiful melancholic memory. When I was a teen I used to love writing stories and coming up with different worlds, characters and mechanics. Somewhere along the road I lost that, thought I could never be good enough at it, and even if I spent effort on practise it would all be a waste. I better get into math, marketing, producing or anything that I might actually land a job with and make a living. The more time passed, the more I felt like I had missed out on it. When I went to study game development I actually steered far away from any creative courses, didn’t even dare to consider narrative design. It all felt out of reach, something I couldn’t make work or worthy of my time, so I started resenting the creative aspects of game development and embracing production and marketing. Now years later when I realised what I had done, the child in me feels fairly betrayed.<br><br>

I’m very much aware I’m not the only one with this issue, far from it. There are so many stories of people growing up creative, getting swept up in to the frenzy of adulthood and corporate jobs and struggling to find their passion. But then there are the other people, few of whom shine a light in my own life, who are so curious and devoted for their craft. They want to learn and create, the passion seeps through the words they speak and inspire others. They know what they are about. I’m not too familiar with other fields, but in the tech industry there seems to be many of them, or at least they are the loud ones. It is part of the culture, life long learning. And sharing about it. I understand it perfectly fine, but what about when you… don’t really give a shit about anything? It just makes me feel like I have 'impostor' written all over me in all caps with a glow in the dark marker and the lights are off.<br><br>

Then there are the others, the third ones, who don’t have a passion and are perfectly happy. They go to their jobs, have their hobbies and get good sleep at night. I don’t know which others I’m more jealous of. I feel like I naturally lean to just doing my job, going to my dance lessons, gym, taking care of chores etc etc. Which I guess I wouldn’t really mind, if it wasn’t for this voice in my head that keeps telling me to do something and that my time is running out. I feel like there is something in me, something I want to say, create, but I’m oblivious to what it actually is. I like art, editing, game development, writing, marketing and production. But liking something just isn’t enough anymore. Not when life is driving you forward way over the speed limit, you are hogtied to the passenger seat and there are no cops in sight. All on their coffee break, I suppose.<br><br>

They say work for 10 minutes a day on your project and eventually it will get finished. 1% better each day and you will reach your goals. That’s all swell and true, but 10 minutes is never just 10 minutes when you are drawing, writing, or doing anything creative. You want that flow to flow baby and let it take you with it to the open sea. That’s where you get shit done. I just can’t find time to travel that far. And every time I give in to the lure of that journey, my sleep schedule gets messed up and I’m upset for the rest of the week.<br><br>

I’m battling on a few fronts here I suppose. One, not being able to make time for creative work, and two, not really knowing what to create in the first place. It all feels like an impossible mountain to climb, since I don’t know if I’ll be even climbing the right mountain. What if I make it half way up there and my eyes meet with the other, sexier mountain in the horizon? Or, even worse, what if I fail to climb in the first place, fall and break my neck? What if I climb it all the way to the top just to find out millions others did it before me and there is no space to place my flag?<br><br>

I feel quite overwhelmed, wanting to give in to the every day and just enjoy the ride as it is. By struggling and forcing myself to be creative, I feel like I’m going against every philosophers’ teachings ever. But then again, I have a giant tattoo on my arm from To The Moon, a game where the protagonist couldn’t achieve his dream when he was alive, and some doctors have to alter his memory to make him think he did just before he dies. I don’t want that. I want to achieve my dream for real in this life. And the dream is creating… something.<br><br>

That’s why I am here, writing this. Just to take baby steps towards that something. I honestly quite like this, writing about whatever I feel like. I should’ve been in bed hours ago, but I don’t think I mind too much.</p>
