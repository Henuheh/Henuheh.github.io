  <h2>Witch's broom</h2>
  <h5>Short story, Jan 20, 2024</h5>
    <p class="blogtext">The early spring rain was coming to a stop as the sun set, as if the rain was changing shifts with the ascending night. By the edge of a field stood a sick spruce, which had appreciated the rain and its playful but gently falling drops that made the tree feel like it was at long last healing. The water caressed its bare hanging branches and rejuvenated its prickly and dry roots. The momentary relief faded with the rain, and the hundred ringed spruce settled back to its pain. It was ready as ever to go into its one last night, just to get it finally over with. When the last sun light took off from its very top needle, the witch's broom that the spruce had carried on its shoulders started to inch open. Inside, a baby boy got his first look at the stars through the unfolding branches.<br><br>


    Doa was crouching with his legs up on a wooden armchair in the living room, seemingly mindlessly browsing through tv channels. Seemingly, because he was actually being very mindful. Just not about the tv.<br>
    “Pick a channel, would you. The noise is driving me absolutely crazy,” Emily shouted over her shoulder, as she had just stomped over to check their empty fridge if some food had happened to manifest in it.<br>
    “You are mad, aren’t you,” Doa whispered, which Emily could hear just fine as the their kitchen was a half meter from the living room.<br>
    “Maybe. Yeah I guess so, I am. I am mad. So what?” Emily answered with a confidence that increased to terrifying heights with each word, slamming the fridge door shut to top it all off.<br>
    “We can talk about it. Would you tell me about it?” Doa moved his stare off the tv to take a look at his pouting partner, who was glaring back at him with eyes that were about to set something on fire, ready to commit arson that would make the headlines for multiple weeks. He had a good guess what it was all about, and his heart sank a little knowing he couldn’t help the person he loved. Doa’s finger kept pressing the increase channel number button on the remote. Not intentionally, it just kept doing what it was used to at this point. It clearly didn’t want to take part in the conversation that was about to be had.<br><br>

    “It doesn’t matter if I tell you about it, it’s the same old topic we have talked through a million times. It never goes anywhere, nothing ever changes, it’s pointless, frustrating, it’s shit I supposedly just need to live with. So, so what?”<br>
    “Oh, I’m sorry. Why did it come up now? You seemed all fine earlier today.”<br>
    “Why does it even matter why it came up now, I’m always mad about it, it’s always a problem! I’m just too tired to cry about it every damn second. Well just so you know, I just got offered a trainee position. Another position I need to turn down.”<br>
    “I’m sorry. I’m sure you will get a chance here, we just need to wait. Just have some patience, please?” Doa tried to plead with a voice that was as calm and empathetic as he was able to produce, but he also started to feel the frustration build up, and this was unfortunately reflected in the ‘please’. It was true, they had had that conversation at least a million times. Doa’s body got restless, his finger tapping even faster.<br><br>

    “I can’t believe how blind a person can be. You are so sweet and caring, so it kills me that you are the dumbest guy I have ever met! You are getting nothing, absolutely nothing but disrespect yet you are ready to sacrifice everything, sacrifice me! How can you even live with yourself like this? Don’t you have any pride in yourself? There is absolutely no reason for us to stay here. I will never get a job in this pathetic little town as it keeps dying down, we have no money, we have no future here! We could be so much better off together, if it wasn’t for your stubborn, cowardly, people pleasing dense brain,” Emily spat out, her voice cracking towards the end. She slightly rocked back and forth while keeping her head down, as she was not able to look at Doa anymore.<br><br>

    “Well fuck off then,” Her partner blurt out casually, which in truth was very much the opposite of a casual thing to say for Doa. He had quickly ran out of his empathy reserve. With each conversation, it seemed to run out faster. Emily plunged forward and slammed the remote from Doa’s hand, from where it struck the tv leaving an impressive crack running through the screen. It got stuck showing some bright blue, magenta and yellow blocks with white pixels snowing here and there. Finally the tv settled on a channel, and the couple could hear a concerned elder citizen call to a talk show to complain about some bushes her landlord had set up behind her kitchen window, which now had a slightly obstructed view.<br><br>

    Doa and Emily stared at each other in horror, with a hint of confusion but an overwhelming doze of adrenaline. After a long minute of listening the talk show hosts pander to the caller, Doa stood up, packed his backpack and walked out the door.<br><br>

    Patches of snow still persisted on the ground, holding on for their dear life under the protective shadows of some evergreens. In a few days even that wouldn’t be enough to keep them around, Doa thought as the scenery flew by the train window. He was on his way to his home village to see his parents. That’s where he had always gone when there was trouble, well, because they were his parents. He had to brake up with Emily, and he was sure his parents would back him up. He didn’t want to, but she left him no choice. Doa’s fingers drummed the windowsill and shoulders shifted in his seat, trying to find a comfortable position as the head rest was positioned way too low by default. It was always like this, Doa didn’t understand why the incompetent seat designers kept getting away with it. His eyes kept glancing the man sitting in front of him. The man had an old sports jacket with some stains on white stripes of the sleeves that clearly wouldn’t wash away anymore. Only god knows if he ever even tried by the looks of the rest of his outfit, Doa judged. The man reeked of beer, as the men like him usually did. He seemed to be asleep, but Doa couldn’t tell for sure.<br><br>

    Doa realised the man actually resembled a lot of his teacher. It wasn’t actually him, as the teacher wasn’t a seemingly homeless alcoholic, but the face was uncannily similar. The teacher was someone you couldn’t help but look up to. He had that calm and cold charisma that held a grip to even the rowdiest students and his jokes were so effortlessly snarky that they knocked you sideways. And most importantly, he wore the most stylish and pristine shoes, they were always like just store bought. No spots on his white sneakers, no wrinkles in his leather loafers. And everybody in the school agreed on it.<br><br>

    Unfortunately for Doa, the teacher didn’t seem to favour him too much. Well, that was the case with most teachers and the students as well, they only acknowledged Doa as a target for mediocre insults. He was the training puppet before they would move on to their real, long-lasting bully-victim relationships. Maybe it was his face or the way he talked, Doa thought. Some people are simply not favoured, that is the way of the world. But the teacher was truly one of a kind. And his fellow students, he had known them for so long. He knew the details of this tiger print hoodie of a boy sitting in front of him in class so that he could draw it from memory. He was pretty nice and he asked to borrow a pen from him once. Doa’s mind went through the students he knew and some moments he recalled of them along the years.<br><br>

     Emily’s words from the fight before showed up unexpected to his mind, rudely interrupting the reel of memories he was enjoying. Doa turned away from the man sitting in front of him and stared out the window for the rest of the train ride.<br><br>

    The trip to his parent’s place was a short one, and soon Doa was knocking behind the door of the house he knew so well. He felt the excitement and warmth in his heart to see his parents again, which covered the pain of the looming breakup for a moment. The door didn’t open, and with each unanswered knock the excitement reluctantly morphed into glimpses of despair and disappointment. Doa jumped off the porch into the flowerbed to peer between the window blinds, and indeed, all the lights in the living room seemed to be off. Doa grabbed his phone and called his mom, his mind racing in horror if there had been a medical emergency that had forced them to leave without giving him a heads up.
    “Hi mom!” Doa greeted full of relief as he heard the call being picked up.<br>
    “Oh, hello,” The stern, older woman voice answered.<br>
    “Hey I just got to the house, but no one is answering the door, where are you?”<br>
    “Oh you were coming today? We left town an hour ago, you should’ve told me that you were going to come today, you weren’t clear about it all,” the voice accused, pulling the rug right under Doa’s flimsy legs with force.<br>
    “Erm, I’m sorry, I thought I-“<br>
    “It’s okay Doa, really, it’s okay, you were being quite emotional, crying and all. You probably just misspoke. Maybe it’s good to calm down a bit before making plans next time, eh?” his mom shifted her tone to keep herself ahead of Doa.<br>
    “Yeah, I guess that is true… But, I mean, where did you go?”<br>
    “We are-“ her voice got cut by some sudden shuffling struggle sounds and vague muffles of what he assumed to be his dad.<br>
    “We are… Just visiting your dad’s friends who had something they needed our help with, and of course we have to, you know how we are,“ His mom’s voice came back with some forced laughs. “You should just go home Doa.”<br><br>
    After lukewarm good byes, Doa was still standing in the flower bench, gazing into his reflection on the window.<br>
    A sad and pathetic man was staring back at him in the dark living room.<br><br>

    An unsettling coldness crept up on him as he kept dwelling in the flower bench, defeated, clueless what to do. He had left his home to go home, and suddenly he had no homes at all. Shivers ran up and down his body as he found himself fighting back the pressure in his eyes that would produce tears if given the chance to. A shred of self awareness hit him, and he, as most people wouldn’t, didn’t want to be seen crying in a bush under a window by neighbours passing by. Doa jumped out of the flowers, some of which had just sprouted but were now fairly trembled. He scurried behind the corner of the house, over a messily wired fence to the backyard. He gave a quick look back just to make sure no one was watching after him, and apologised to the poor plants.<br><br>

    The backyard was overgrown, with a rusty swing and some of his childhood toys, which were the last decade played with by nature. As if in a trance, Doa’s steps took him to a little bridge that led from the yard to the forest over a small brook that divided the two.<br><br>

    Breathing in the nurturing and empathetic countryside air, he felt a familiar melancholic clarity settle on him. Doa had only felt that way a few times in his life before, and as the feeling eventually disappeared so would the memory of having it. But here it was, once again, dawning upon him as he traversed in the forest he knew like the back of his hand from when he played there as a kid. He could now see himself through Emily’s eyes, and Doa let out a pathetic laugh. He really had a dense, people pleasing brain, he thought to himself. As much as he despised himself in that moment, he knew that this clarity was only momentary, a rare fleeting vision. He had to go back to Emily before his sight would be obstructed by the misshapen clouds, behind which Emily would disappear for good. He couldn’t afford to loose the only person who was more than fool’s gold to him.<br><br>

    Doa’s determined steps had taken him through the trees to an open field, which formed almost a perfect circle in the middle of the forest. He remembered the place from his childhood, but only vaguely since he didn’t used to wander this far out too often. Doa stopped by the edge of the golden sea and watched the gentle wind form waves that rippled through it. If his mind wasn’t fighting his whole existence in the moment he could’ve appreciated the setting sun kissed view a bit more, but even now it didn’t completely pass him by. In the field, he saw her looking at him. He didn’t want to loose this sight, he wanted to tell her she has always been right and to take him away from there. Doa’s determination turned into a few tears which formed to the corner of his eyes. He let them roll down, as if wiping them would wipe away his clarity. Doa truly had come to the realisation that nothing else in his life mattered, regardless of how his memories wanted to tie him down.<br><br>

    Doa turned to leave and take the first train back to Emily, but he noticed his feet wouldn’t lift off from the ground. Confused, he tried to tear his legs from whatever was holding them down, but no matter what, they wouldn’t budge. Doa started panicking and he pulled too hard, which threw him off balance. As he fell, his feet stayed flat on the ground, dislocating both of his ankles and the boy screamed from pain. <br><br> His vision blurred and the pain numbed his mind for a moment, cold sweat streaming down his back. Doa tried to crawl forward in the dirt, but it was no use, his feet were part of the ground. The quiet spring evening by the field was now filled by Doa's painful cries and grunts, that got carried by the gentle wind all the way to the other side of it, where more forest streached out for miles. Unfortately, there was no one to hear him. No one that would be able to help, anyway. By some higher power Doa managed to push himself up, and the adrenaline that rushed through him covered the pain of standing upright. Even though he was completely overtaken by hysteria, he got the sudden clarity to simply remove his shoes, since they must have gotten stuck somehow and now kept him in place. But to the boy’s horror, as he tried to bend over, he noticed that his legs had also stopped working. Doa’s upper body started to stiffen up, and the last thing he felt was his roots growing in the soil.</p>
