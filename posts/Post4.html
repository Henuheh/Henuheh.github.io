  <h2>Sit Down</h2>
  <h5>Short story, Mar 10, 2024</h5>
    <p>Iris stared down at the pitch black tunnel in an everyday, casual type of anticipation. <br>
       <i>There</i>, she noted to herself the moment a distant rumble got carried to her ears and reached her temporal lobe. <br>
       A second later the tunnel went from pitch black to just black, then dark gray, somewhat of a #C6B45E, bright yellow, and lastly a blinding white before a subway shot out of the opening. Iris’s eyes followed the fast moving train as it approached, but locked her gaze head on when she spotted her reflection on the windows flying by. Her shoulder length light brown hair was hanging down flat. It laid thin but messy from the gust of stuffy underground tunnel air the subway had delivered with it and oil from a gym session earlier that day. The hair framed her oval head as if it was glued on and shined bright like a beacon under the cold overhead subway lights. An oversized jacket that had stains from a few seasons ago and a gray plastic shopping bag hanged off from her, and together with her ripped jeans, of which the holes had grown in diameter by quite a sum since she had originally bought them, gave an impression. Iris wasn’t a fan. <br>
<i>A fresh stain from homeless.</i> <br>
The subway gradually slowed down to a stop, perfectly positioned to the whole length of the platform, and Iris waited in the distance as the doors opened and people flooded out. It was the rush hour, and people were in an intense hurry to get home, so much so that they forgot human decency and tried to flood in before the previous flood had made it out. Two floods colliding always ended up with elbows in stomachs, so Iris let the busy people do their thing and followed them into the subway from a safe distance. <br><br>

Inside, there were still quite a few spots free to sit down on and Iris navigated to one in the middle of the carriage. The plastic bench felt cold on her thighs as she sat down and placed her shopping bag between her legs. There were some older men beside her, to whom she didn’t pay much attention. The subway gave the auditory doors closing warning and accelerated into the tunnel ahead.<br><br>

Iris looked along the subway and through all the passengers, ultimately staring into nothingness. At first, her thoughts innocently bounced back and forth as they often do, but a moment later one of them in over eagerness and inconsiderateness made the mistake of crossing <i>the</i> line. She quickly caught it and tried to force it back over, but her resolve struggled, and the thought broke free. She felt quite weak. Recently, her body had a hard time carrying her and she got exhausted from what used to feel like a nonchalant run in the park. Iris tried to breathe in and out consciously, let herself relax, but her thought had now gotten a running start and was already out of reach. Her brows deepened their frown and cold shivers waved through her as her thoughts delved deeper and deeper into the forbidden territory. The discomfort of the mind quickly spread to her body as she struggled to control herself and had no choice but to surrender. Iris had to rip her attention from within to the outside, but didn’t like what she was seeing there either. Her eyes now took a focus on the people around her, jumping from one face to another. <br>
<i>There are too many people here. All these old, grown up losers without a car, should be ashamed of themselves. Especially this one and this one here. </i><br>
Iris’s outlook had morphed in her discomfort from disinterested and unfocused to very tense and determinately untolerant.<br>
 <i>I can’t stand their faces. God, I can’t look at them, not anyone. </i><br><br>

But Iris couldn’t look away, she kept eyeing everyone in the carriage one by one. The subway slowed down to a stop as it arrived to the next station, and to Iris’s relief, a few people exited. Unfortunately, to her pre-existing horror, even more entered from the platform.<br>
 <i>No, no. Go back out, she cursed as the newcomers approached her looking for a place to sit.</i> <br>
<i>Don’t come near me! What are you staring at, why are you looking at me? I just want- <br><br>

Wait… What if I’m in someone’s place? <br><br>

What if someone is supposed to sit here where I sit? </i><br><br>

An agonizing smile took form on her face as the realization dawned on her like the first sun after the dead of winter. <br><br>

<i>Of course, of course I’m in her place! It's so obvious, how blind do I have to be for not seeing it before? Maybe I already knew it but refused to acknowledge it… She must be so much more special than I am. She will glare me down and push me off, and nobody around will bat an eye, because I was in her seat. There are too many people, it could be anyone here. Is it you? Maybe you? What do I do if someone comes up to me? I can’t take another seat, it won’t be mine either. Will she punch me? Laugh at me? Spit on me? Smile down at me knowing I have nowhere to go anymore? What do I do?</i><br><br>

Iris’s back started to sweat and she shifted side to side in her seat. The passengers near her started to take notice, but out of politeness didn’t stare. <br><br>

<i>Oh god, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry to whoever’s seat I’m on, I know it’s not mine and I shouldn’t have sat down,</i> Iris pleaded in her mind, her eyes starting to water and head ache. She quickly understood she couldn’t just sit and wait for her inevitability.<br>
<i>She is probably still not here, maybe I can get out before she comes. Yes, I can run, I should run,</i> She reasoned and jumped up from her seat. Iris hastily took a few steps, but suddenly stopped, turned around and shouted: “I am so, so sorry!” with an astounding repentance. <br><br>
Now the other passengers did allow themselves to stare. <br><br>
Not wasting a moment more she turned back and started running towards the other end of the subway, holding her arms in front of her while bumping into passengers on the slim aisle. Someone shouted something after her. <br>
<i>No! She is following me! But I left the seat, it’s yours! I- </i><br>
The subway took a steep left, trembled and threw Iris off her balance. Her body slammed against the wagon’s closed doors and her mind blacked out. A few seconds later she found herself on her back with an extremely painful shoulder. Her vision was blurry and head hurt twice as hard as she tried to orient herself upright, her already sore body making it difficult in the rocking wagon. As she looked up she saw figures reaching to grab her. 
“No!” Iris screamed from the top of her lungs with a voice full of genuine terror, and the figures startled and stopped approaching. Iris took advantage of that still moment, got back on her feet and sprinted towards the end of the subway. She heard steps echoing behind her in the otherwise silent train. The sound of the steps got closer and closer even though she felt like she was running as fast as she could. The lights in the subway suddenly blinked and turned off, and Iris heard some screams behind her. She didn’t see where she was running anymore, but her instincts pulled her forward regardless. <br><br>

Light poured into the subway from the window as the train arrived to the next stop. Iris saw the end wall of the train just in time to stop herself before she would’ve hit a hard metal surface for the second time. The lights turned back on and the subway came to a stop. The moment the doors were wide enough apart for her to go through, Iris leaped out. <br><br>

She had exited to the dead end of the platform so when she glanced to her left she saw people walking away from her to exit the subterranean maze. She glanced over her shoulder and saw the doors closing back up and the subway accelerating away right after. The platform was now void of people, so no one saw Iris as she fumbled a few steps forward, fell on her knees and threw up on the granite. <br>

<i>She didn’t catch up to me!</i> Her thoughts rejoiced, masterfully ignoring the burning in her throat and foulness in her mouth. Unfortunately, the joy was short lived as she saw people descending down to the platform from the other end. They were too far for her to see clearly, but she saw a figure approaching her with determined steps. <br>
<i>Fuck, how did she pull that off?! </i>Iris panicked as she scrambled back on her feet. Now, there was nowhere to run, she was trapped in the end of the platform and the only way out would be through her. But Iris knew she would never be able to face her. <br><br>

<i>I would rather jump under the oncoming subway.</i> <br><br>

<i>Actually...</i> <br><br>
Iris glared at the person who was already drawing near, seemingly stepping up her pace as she got closer to her. Crouching, Iris backed up a few steps, not taking her eyes off the oncomer. The oncomer started to run as she realized what Iris was up to, and without hesitation, Iris jumped. <br><br>

Iris’s feet landed sternly with a loud thud between the railing, her knees absorbing most of the shock. Knowing she didn’t have time to wait around for the pain to thaw, Iris forced her legs on the move with a few painful groans and bolted into the subway tunnel, the darkness devouring her instantly.<br><br>

The sounds of the platform quickly faded away as she ran and got some distance covered. Her panting echoed in the tunnel with her footstep, hearing only distant but imposing rumbles vibrating through her by the subways speeding somewhere in the system. But there was no mistaking it, mixed with her footsteps were a pair of others, only some distance behind her. <br>
<i>Fuck I couldn’t have imagined she would come after me, fucking god damn her to hell!</i> Iris cursed, barely being able to keep her running pace anymore as her chest felt tight and breathing cumbersome. Her eyes slowly got used to the dark and she started making out faint outlines of the railing which helped her place her steps more confidently. She noticed the  glow of exit signs one after another running along the lower edge of the slightly curved walls.  <br><br>

<i>Dear god let that exit come quickly. I don’t have much time anymore. The subway's wait time was maybe three minutes, fuck, I have no clue how long has it been… I need, I need to get out, I need to figure something out, now! </i>Iris panicked as she now felt the pressure of two deadly things on her tail, having no idea how long she would have. Maybe minutes, maybe only tens of seconds. The other footsteps were still echoing behind her, clearly not too far off. <br><br>

<i>Why oh why the hell am I this unlucky? I have truly tried my best, why do I end up in shit like this? What have I fucking done to deserve this? If I had just gotten out in the next station I could’ve gone out the other end and exited out, I wouldn’t have trapped myself! Fuck those old stations, death traps, that’s what they are.</i> Iris’s thoughts ran as fast as she, having a hard time not pitying herself after everything. <br>
But then a thought struck her like an oncoming train.<br>
<i>Wait if it was the last station of the early built ones, that’s as far as the subway travels during the night before heading back… Which means… Which means there’s a run around loop!</i> Iris shifted to the left to make sure she saw that side of the railing and the wall as well as she possibly could.<br>
<i>God if you have any mercy for me left, you have not let me pass that junction yet, I’m praying, praying so fucking bad, listen to me!</i><br><br>
The wall stayed intact on her left and the chaser’s footsteps consistent behind her. Iris was completely out of breath, her legs aching and chest on the verge of cramping. <br><br>
<i>There.</i> Iris noted to herself as the familiar rumble got carried to her ears, first ever so faintly, but it grew louder fast and steady. Iris knew she was only moments away from her death. 
She was already pleading her last minute forgiveness from God as she saw a break in the exit signs on her left, and the train track dividing into two next to it. Without a second  thought Iris leaped into the diverting tunnel and glued herself to the wall as intimately as she possibly could. Her body wanted to inhale the largest and loudest gasps of her life but she didn’t let it and held her breath, her body fighting fiercely back. <br><br>

A dark figure ran past her in the main tunnel, quickly disappearing out of sight behind the corner. <br><br>
Iris continued to held her breath in. <br><br>

A faint light appeared on the wall of the main tunnel, illuminating it dark gray. A muddled yellow, a bright white. The subway shot passed her, the carts blurring by in the darkness. And in an instant it was gone, its rumble echoing for a while behind it, but soon fading after it. <br><br>

She listened. <br><br>

Nothing. <br><br>

Iris took the deepest breath of her life, which quickly morphed into loud, rapid pants that echoed in the tunnels. She felt like fainting on the spot, so she dropped down on her hands ready to fall, but with every breath her mind slowly came back to. Iris was shaking, crouching in the darkness, adrenaline gushing inside, her mind in complete disbelief that she was still alive. <br><br>

Some time went by. Another subway glided past, Iris still bended over with her hands planted on to the ground. Her body took a few more subways to feel like it could try to take a shot at moving again, after her breath had finally stabilized to a relatively normal pace. In her head, after being able to put together coherent thoughts again, Iris was celebrating the successful escape from the pursuer. <br><br>
<i>Ha ha, not today, whore! I don’t care how worthless and incapable I am, one thing is for sure. I won’t let you get to me. I will kill you, or myself if it comes to that.</i> She didn’t feel regretful for the chance that the pursuer got run over by the subway in the slightest. <i>Today, I got lucky.</i> <br><br>

Iris realized now, first time taking in her surroundings, that the tunnel had a very musky and moist, suffocating air that smelled a weird mix of oil and dirt. Her eyes had gotten completely used to the dark and she could see the intersection, its crossed railings, faintly glowing exit signs and a little elevated platform with a handrail leading further down the runaround loop. As her senses got numbed by the pressing silence and depressingly dark and cold surroundings, Iris’s momentary rejoicing got shadowed by the descenting reality of the situation. Just like on the platform earlier, her joys were short lived. <br>
<i>I will have to fight forever… I will have to run every day. She will be back as long as I’m here.</i><br><br>

Iris got up, her clouded mind taking its time to instruct each limb what to do. Another subway shot by ruffling her hair, as Iris vaguely weighed between her equally miserable options. She simply couldn’t come to a conclusion, whether she should go or stay. Both options felt like shots in the dark that she knew would, despite their expected imprecise aim, end up killing her. <br>
<i>I’m too much of a coward for the right thing, too self aware for the wrong thing. So in other words, most definitely fucked.</i> Iris laughed at herself. <i> I belong here, trapped in this dusty, suffocating darkness. I get it.</i> <br><br>


There was a peculiar sensation, and a light reflected from the tunnel wall into her eye from somewhere behind. Iris swiftly turned around and to her surprise, she noticed a door cracked open on the elevated platform on the right side of the tunnel that led into the runaround loop.  Iris stared for a moment as if waiting for a mirage to quiver and fade, but the steel door stayed solid and the light emitting from behind it bright. With careful curiosity, Iris approached. The door was a mere ten feet down the tunnel and Iris stopped in front of it, eyeing it dubiously. Standing now so close to it, she could hear a scenery taking shape behind the door and her expression got even more confused.<br><br>
<i>Is that a magpie? How on earth could’ve one gotten lost down here? It also sounds as if the wind is blowing… </i> She wondered in disbelief, her curiosity growing into ineffable proportions. Like a cat, she effortlessly jumped onto the elevated platform over the handrail and wrapped her fingers around the door handle. Slowly opening it, she drowned in the outflowing light. She stepped in, blinded. Iris finally felt like she was something.
