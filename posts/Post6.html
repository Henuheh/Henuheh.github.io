  <h2>Jooa</h2>
  <h5 class="blogdatepost">Short story, Dec 18, 2023</h5>
    <p class="chapter">First chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">

One day, Jooa simply can’t take it anymore. Desperate to fix himself, he opens the door to his heart. Not able to see it coming, all of his emotions break free through his unbarred chest like water that abruptly bursts through an inconspicuous crack in a dam. The boy reaches after them, arm stretched out and finger tips almost caressing the slowest of the bunch, but it is too late. He stands there with an expressionless face, watches them soar away. As an empty husk from what he was before, he does not hurt anymore.<br><br>


Then there are birds.<br><br>
</p>

<p class="chapter"> First and then some chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">As there is not much point in just being, Jooa takes the old boat and the oars from a shed and sets sail on the calm lake by his run-down little cottage. As the house and its untamed shoreline get smaller and smaller in front of him, he wonders what is home.<br><br></p>

<p class="chapter">Second chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">In the forest there is a swan, whose head is hanging low, eyes laying closed and body staying still, as if her legs are frozen to the lake. Feathers are lifeless, hanging heavy from a black substance the swan is emitting into the air and water around her. The blackness slowly creeps on the water's surface, reaching the shore, climbing up the trees, taking over houses of the nearby village, forcing the animals to pack their few belongings and say goodbye to their neighbors. Marras, an overwhelming power, had spread from the depths of the forest to the very edge, and the villager’s mother had lost the fight and could no longer protect her people. <br>
“It corrodes the soul, wraps around your heart, tightens its grip and tests its limits. It will latch onto anything you got, so be careful”, a Raven warns Jooa as he moors the boat to a tree. However, as Jooa is completely empty, his steps take him only forward. He acknowledges the warning, but hardly minds, so he walks through the forest to the lake and greets the black swan. She struggles to get her head up, the black substance slips down her neck as she fights its weight, but she pulls through to take a look at what is standing in front of her. With the little amount of mind of her own that she still has, she looks at the boy with pitying, not quite understanding but feeling sorry regardless, eyes. She lets her wings fall down and takes a long breath, taking in the nurturing forest air for the last time. Marras eats through her body and she withers away, but consequently the black power scatters and fades out as it consumes its own source. The village is saved. Jooa notices something familiar laying on the water bed where she had just rested. He takes it in his hand and love eagerly returns to him.<br><br></p>


<p class="chapter">Third chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">“That’s a nice thing you got there. You should go home kid, take care of it before something happens to it. No need to risk yourself by going further, right?” A frog sitting on a lily pad nearby offers his five cents to the boy.<br>
“But he might just suck it dry. I heard it can happen, they said it’s the worst.” Another one chips in from under a rock. Jooa takes a minute to consider, takes another, even a third. Heartened by the love, he appreciates the advice from the frogs. However, as much as he is cradled by the warm embrace of love from the tips of his toes to the ends of the coarse blonde strands of hair on his head, he knows that’s not all he lost. Love can get lonely in an empty heart. Jooa takes a step, takes another, then a third. He waves his goodbye to the frogs, who wave back, thankful for the boy for saving them. Smiling politely, they know full well that Marras will eventually return, but they don’t feel like bringing it up.<br><br>

The deeper into the forest the path takes Jooa, the more prevalent Marras becomes around him. Villages are abandoned, the paths overgrown, and whoever is left behind is suffering. The patches of glistening green grass blades that have survived and the white and purple petals of a few similarly lucky flowers shine so brightly in the midday sun against the black matter that Jooa finds himself admiring the threatened nature’s beauty everywhere around him. Life becomes much more alive next to death. But death is not there just to look good, and as Jooa presses on he fights for his love against the strengthening Marras. It dawns on the boy that his scavenger hunt might be more dangerous than he originally thought.<br><br>

Jooa comes across a town, one that is submerged in a blue hue as if it was drowned, full of little lakes and deep swampland. The few citizens that were still around might as well have all been fish, as on the streets they swim while Jooa is very much walking with feet on the ground. Tiny caviar sized blue and green balls of light float around and illuminate moist weeds that climb up the village houses. Jooa’s eyes sparkle in their light, and he stops by every seldom passer-by to offer a helping hand. Not that he can really help much as he lacks the know-how to actually, well, help the creatures contaminated with Marras without killing them. Nevertheless, they appreciate his efforts, and his boyish naivety warms many hearts. Those which are still able to get warm, anyway. His hands lead him to the keeper of the town, Vellamo. Jooa finds her in the middle of the town, completely corrupted by Marras, turning her citizens into haunted minions to deploy and spread this dark power further around the forest. She notices Jooa, and without giving a breather to even utter the first syllable of a greeting she attacks him with bold and blind aggression. Barely withstanding this vortex of Marras, Jooa cherishes his love, and while leaving him vulnerable from the back, he directs his power at Vellamo who was just inches away from him to finish it all. By almost pure luck, Jooa emerges victorious and Vellamo ceases to exist without Marras within her.<br><br>
Jooa finds his curiosity left behind on the battlefield.<br><br></p>

<p class="chapter">Fourth chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">Eager to find out what would wait for him next, he ventures forth to try his luck. Questions about Marras and its origins fascinate him as he hears stories from the forest folk while journeying forward. Some say it to be death released by the gods to punish them, while others regard it as a phenomenon of nature that was born out of pure but cruel misfortune. Jooa’s curiosity drives him forward to take down even stronger Marras creatures, which are emerging on his path attracted by his newfound emotion. <br><br>
Fortunately, Jooa doesn’t stray far and reaches the kingdom of the forest.<br><br>
The king of the forest was a majestic elk, but he had gone mad with emotion. Emotion holds the most power in the forest and it is the only weapon to fight Marras, and deathly afraid of the black power the king eventually went out his head for it. But his emotions ended up dirty, as they were gained in shady ways from dark alleyways. Dirty emotions lead to filthy feelings, and so in a cruel twist of fate the king got corrupted long before the blackness could ever even get to him. But Marras crept closer and closer and as a last resort with his unstable powers he did everything he could to find the source of emotions. The source is a thing of rumors hiding behind a respected mystical veil, a thing to be left as it is. As Marras took over his mind he changed his plans from getting all the emotions he could to destroying the source completely. Fortunately, Jooa lets him out of his misery before the king is able to raise the veil and find the source to go through with his plans. And so, Jooa finds himself Happiness.<br><br></p>

<p class="chapter">Fifth chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">Now in the absence of a king, the forest people cry out. Some in gratitude of getting rid of the Marras ridden king, others in despair for who would guide them and lead the battle against Marras when it eventually returns.<br><br>

Jooa finds himself in his journey’s crossroads. He has what he holds most dear, his love, his curiosity and his happiness, but he knows that it wasn’t all he let go. He is ever so troubled, walking in circles, trying to reason with himself why it is okay to go back home halfhearted. The temptation is high and coming up with reasons is easy. He helped the forest to repel Marras to some extent, but what would he even be able to do about it if it will just come back again? Surely he can’t stay there forever, he needs to go home. If he continues farther, the power might be overwhelming, and the happiness he just found makes him quite keen on the whole being alive thing. The forest will probably die, but at the end of the day, he is just a visitor. The residents will hopefully move away and start even better lives somewhere else for sure. Besides, why would anyone willingly choose to live with the emotions he was about to leave behind?<br><br>




A man, a sage and a smith, from the place most would consider home, comes across the boy on his way home. He can see an ever so slight doubt hiding on his face behind the lightheartedness. The man tells him, teaches him: “I see your joy and wonder, you weightlessly dancing on water. But since you have no weight, you will never meet no depths. That’s where life is, exploding and drowning in beauty, while you are left looking behind the glass and leaving messy fingerprints.” <br><br>

Like a compass needle realizing it was pointing to south this entire time and feeling self-conscious about it, his love, curiosity and happiness shiftly change direction. Now Jooa’s journey takes him to the home of Marras, beyond the mountain range that divides the forest in half. As he enters a cave that leads him through the mountain, he sees a glimpse of a girl standing still in the middle of a batch of birch trees, her eyes locked on him. With a child-like shyness she stares, sun shine penetrating the tree leaves and glimmering on the tears rolling down her face. Jooa figures to leave her be, as she is clearly there just to observe.<br><br>

The cave narrows down and as the light from the entrance can’t reach any further, darkness closes in on the boy and his dimly lit oil lamp. The only sound he can hear is the wind blowing somewhere distant ahead, traveling through the cave and breathing air into the mountain. Stuck in time and space, between two worlds calling, Jooa feels pressure building up in this tiny hollow he is crawling through. It is his own space, occupied by only spirits with him, but what if the roof collapses and the rocks come tumbling down? What if the entrance and exits get blocked and the air runs out? What if the darkness eats him and he becomes part of the cave? What if what entered the cave is not the same that exits it?<br><br>

Fresh air caresses Jooa’s lungs and a tiny speck of light appears in front of him, growing bigger until the boy exits through it. He appears onto some barren hills before a dark forest, a world where gray clouds decided to stick around for good and a cold wind blows beneath them menacingly. On the mossy hills a viper is waiting for Jooa, guarding Marras from any emotions leaking from the other side of the mountain. The viper is vicious, blindly attacking with instinct. Unlucky for Jooa, the instinct happens to be quite sharp and the boy finds himself having to push his body up from the cold ground time and time again. With patience Jooa gets the upper hand from the viper and ends her. Marras sheds from her, falling from the hills back into the forest. Jooa quickly snatches his fear up from the ground before it has the chance to pick up speed and roll down.<br><br>

Jooa’s body starts to violently shake even before his brain has the time to tell him what to feel. He doesn’t want to go further. He is alone, he is weak. A deep and dark shadow casts over his heart and he freezes in place. He stares over the treetops into the distance, fear in his eyes filtering the view into a distorted painting by a meticulous madman. Thoughts run through his head like he wishes his legs would, and he is incapable of returning back to reality. He hears his own heart beat through his chest, composing a masterful piece with the shrieking forest and the howling wind, a piece that plays when you hide from a monster in a closet. The shadows of the trees start climbing up the hill, making their way up to the boy and taking shapes of twisted men. Unable to help himself, Jooa closes his eyes and greets god, after a long time of just walking by, looking at his feet and avoiding eye contact like he doesn’t recognise him. <br><br>

He doesn’t notice at first, but slowly the grip of fear starts settling, cradling and finding harmony with the other emotions. The wind feels comforting in its steady continuousness, the rocks beneath his feet trustable in their harsh coldness, and the forest falls quiet again. The shadows draw back and movement returns to his body.  The fear makes the boy doubtful, but with faith he pushes on.<br><br> </p>

<p class="chapter">Sixth chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">Through the thick and grim lit forest that Marras thrives in, Jooa’s steps are small and carefully placed. Spruce trees are ravaged by disease, dead down the middle, prickly dry branches stinging every passer-by and spiderwebs woven between every clearing. On the path that Jooa is considered an unwelcome flaneur by the forest and its inhabitants alike, he finds a mom bear attending to her cubs. The mom bear senses Jooas presence from a great distance, because to her Jooa’s emotions stink like a concoction of spoiled milk, eggs, assortment of root vegetables and fish in a saucepan forgotten on the porch on an exceptionally hot summer day. She attacks, leaving Jooa no choice but to fight back. In the heat of the moment, quite counterintuitively, a part of him gets cold feet (his feet, probably) and tries to look for a window to flee the battle. Hesitation to find out what the bear would leave behind for Jooa makes him hold back and barely withstand the claws’ fury. Regardless, he has to see the battle through to kill Marras and set the cubs free from the caring but slowly killing touch of their mom. As she withers away, Jooa gets his Anger back.<br><br>

Enraged and frustrated from having to continuously fight and kill innocent creatures because of Marras, coming all this way just to get back ugly feelings, losing his emotions in the first place, Jooa rushes through the darkness, stampeding over spider webs and prickly branches giving him bright red cuts, shouting to find Marras, to find its source, to end it all. He is determined to let the forest live, even if it means for him to suffer. No one should die anymore, and he will take back what he was so desperate to get rid of in the first place. It was him who released the pain that brought forth the rampant turmoil after all. <br><br></p>

<p class="chapter">Seventh chapter</p>

<p class="blogtext">The anger doesn’t settle quite as easily as fear did before it, and going almost blind with rage he comes across a sea. It is storming somewhere in the distance, but too far for Jooa to see it, only the roars and rumbles are carried to him by the restless waves. He stands there for a while listening to the breaking water, and calms down, as the sea generously gives him acceptance over his anger. After taking in multiple lungfuls of the salty sea air, Jooa thanks the waters and starts finding his way down the shore, as the forest comes to its end and he can't go any further. He comes across an entrance to a cave in the ground, and inside of it, encounters a wolf.<br><br>

Marras is slowly leaking out of the cave into the forest air. It nests in the cracks of the cave’s walls and drifts through the air, condensing into spherical masses, the likes of which imagination identifies as black holes. They suck in the light from outside leaving the cave barely visible, but just enough so that Jooa can see the wolf, from which Marras is being born. Jooa gets stuck in a loop of distressed thoughts between overwhelming and paralyzing fear, and anger that is boiling beneath the surface ready to spill over and take action. The owner of his pain, the one bringing ruin to the forest’s towns and villages, making innocents suffer, poisoning each and every heart, corrupting each and every mind, forcing its way through with no regard to life. What is it living for anyway? Is it living? Would it know any other way to live? There must be a reason. Maybe its intentions are authentic and pure, but it just happens to materialize in such a misfortunate way? Jooa feels Marras knocking on his door. He realizes he can’t walk back anymore, he either has to open that door or kill the wolf and embrace his pain, there is no middle ground to stand on. The wolf is still just standing there, oozing Marras from within, waiting patiently for Jooa to act. But Jooa’s thoughts overheat, he has let himself run too hot and his fuse blows before he can make a move. Not being able to even lift a finger, he can only keep looking back at the giant creature in front of him. The wolf’s eyes, despite leaking black from marras, start to look warm and somber. Jooa feels Marras getting in, he feels it falling slowly to his lungs, defiling the oxygen. Into his ears, filling them with the ugliest noise. Into his blood, rushing for his heart. <br><br>

Oh, if only to stop time. Not having to feel its crushing pressure, inevitableness, take forever to think, forever to ponder, never to decide.<br><br>

Unfortunately, life doesn’t really care for that kind of leisure and undecidedness, it walks forward with determination no matter how hard you try to cling to its leg like a child to stop it from taking the next step.<br><br>

Jooa is falling asleep, his eyelids inch close by the weight of a mountain but he sees the blurry wolf take a step closer just before his vision blacks out, or at least he thinks he might’ve seen. He can’t really trust his own senses anymore, everything is nothing, subjectively. Subjectively, as if anything else matters anyway. Marras had kicked the door in and is furiously looking for the boy’s heart, after taking over the soul the rest of the body would be breezy haymaking. Marras finds what it is looking for, but gets caught off guard by Jooa’s emotions waiting for it. After all the trouble they have been through, they are determined to stay home this time. Jooa feels his heart take a beat like never before, the only muscle moving in his otherwise limp body. The startled Marras retreats and loosens its grip for a second, but the second is long enough for Jooa to realize it might be his last. He struggles two steps forward to free himself from the blanket of Marras that covers him, as if emerging from a pool of acid slime, and takes a breath like that of an only just resurrected man. The boy attacks the astonished wolf, who had already revealed his teeth to take a bite. <br><br>

It is a long and tedious fight, but in the end Jooa wins. Marras is no more and Jooa sees his sadness lay in a puddle in the middle of the cave, where the wolf had just fought, giving its all. The emotion slowly drifts towards Jooa. He closes his eyes, timid but ready to accept his sadness back. It strucks him with immense force, like a tidal wave that soared into the cave and slammed him on the rocks. Then, for the first time, as the sorrow and pain take over, he feels wholeheartedly. <br><br>

A tear rolls down next to the bridge of his nose to the right cheek. It lingers on the chin for a moment but then drops down his arm, falls along and creates a start of a small pond in the palm of his hand. One falls after another, filling up the cave.<br><br>

Life returns to the forest.</p>
